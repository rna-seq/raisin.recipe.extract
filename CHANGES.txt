1.1.1 (2012-07-04)
==================

Features
--------

- Reduce the requirements for profile definitions to the minimum in order to support
  legacy projects that didn't use grape.buildout. This can also be helpful when the
  accessions and profiles are not available for a project, but the MySQL database
  still contains the project.
